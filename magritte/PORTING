Changes to be made upon porting:

- remember to omit MACompatibility
- delete MADescriptionBuilder>>register and its callers
- delete MADescriptionBuilder>>unregister and its callers
- delete one copy of BlockClosure>>asDynamicObject if you wish
- go through all class extensions and prefix the namespace "Magritte"
  to all references to Magritte classes.
- other rules needed:

  Character cr->Character nl

  (``@object nextPutAll: self class name) -> (``@object store: self class)

  ``@object evaluatorClass) -> Behavior

  (SystemChangeNotifier uniqueInstance doSilently: ``@arg2) -> ``@arg2 value

  ``@object evaluatorClass) -> Behavior

  (``@object organization listAtCategoryNamed: ``@arg2) -> (
    ``@object selectors select: [ :each | (``@object >> each) methodCategory = ``@arg2 ])

- remove 
   #visitColorDescription:
   MAColorChooser
   MAColorComponent
   MAColorDescription (and places where it is "added", in Magritte-Seaside)

- remove String>>#lines.
- in MAAutoSelectorAccessor add brackets to methods created by
  #createReadAccessor: and #createWriteAccessor:
- in MAAutoSelectorAccessorTest>>#tearDown eliminate the call to
  #removeCategory:.
- in MAVariableAccessor class>>#name:, add #asSymbol
- in MAExternalFileModel>>#contents, change "stream contents" to "stream contents asByteArray"
- remove MADynamicObjectTest>>#testNilOrNotNil (cannot pass on GNU Smalltalk right now)

- there is some problem with exceptions that screws up SUnit :-) if a test
  fails with an error.  to work around it, disable
  MADynamicObjectTest>>#testException until you fix all testsuite errors.

- in Magritte-Seaside, add "Magritte import: Seaside" at the top, and add
  "Seaside." before class definitions that subclass from seaside (grep
  for /^WA/).
